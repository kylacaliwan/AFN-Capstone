# Requirement Modeling

Project: AFN Service Management  
Prepared for: Capstone documentation

## 1. Context Diagram

The context diagram shows the AFN Service Management system as one central system interacting with external users and services.

### Main Service Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Client submits service request]
    B[System stores request and location]
    C[Admin approves request]
    D[System creates service ticket]
    E[Admin or auto-dispatch assigns technician]
    F[Technician starts work]
    G[Technician submits inspection and proof]
    H[Ticket is completed]
    I[After-sales, warranty, or maintenance records are created when needed]
    J[Client or admin creates a new request or ticket when another visit is needed]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H --> I --> J
    J -. service lifecycle continues .-> A
```

The workflow is intentionally semi-automated after completion. The system can create follow-up cases, warranty handoffs, maintenance schedules, and notifications from completed tickets and checklist data. It does not automatically create a new `ServiceRequest` for every follow-up or maintenance record; the next request or ticket is created through the normal user or administrator workflow when another service visit is needed.

## 3. Entity Relationship Diagram

The ERD is maintained as DBML so it can be imported into dbdiagram.io and exported as an image for the final paper.

Main capstone ERD:

```text

## What It Represents

This database diagram reflects the actual Django models in the AFN Service Management System:

- User accounts and role profiles
- Admin settings and capability grants
- Service types, SLA rules, service requests, and locations
- Service tickets, crew assignments, status history, progress, and service history
- Technician skills and location history
- Inspection checklist and proof records
- After-sales cases and maintenance schedules
- Inventory categories, items, reservations, transactions, and service inventory requirements
- Ticket-linked messages
- Notifications, templates, logs, and Firebase tokens
- Activity logs and change logs
- Analytics, technician performance, demand forecasts, and service trends

## Note For Defense

This is a physical/logical database diagram. It is different from the Chen-style ERD and the DFD:

- **Database diagram:** tables, fields, primary keys, foreign keys
- **ERD:** entities and relationships
- **DFD:** how data moves through processes

For the database diagram, the DBML file is the most accurate source because it maps directly to the Django model structure.
